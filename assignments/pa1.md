     1. Sarah would like to register for an account in order to start managing her business without needing to put a lot of effort into her online presence. She can start by accessing the registration portion of our module. There, she can register herself or her company to be part of the trading platform. Once she registers, her information will be presented to her, allowing her to manage her business. This will include user information, bank details, user portfolio and trading information.

     2. Sarah would like to make a change to her banking information in the trading platform because she has added another account associated with her business. She can find her banking information associated with her registered account and be able to make changes once signed in. Once she locates the banking information she wants to change, she can add, edit or delete bank account information. This will allow her to make changes to his account for her current banking needs.
     3. Sarah wants to have a location to manage her company's portfolio of assets. She can find this in Portfolio Management when signed in to her account. Here, she can see a list of all her owned assets with a real-time portfolio valuation. She will be able to directly manage this with the ability to add or remove assets from the company portfolio. Once asset changes are made, the portfolio valuation will change to better help her manage her portfolio. Other data like historical performance tracking and market data integration will be provided to help her better manage her assets as well.
     4. Sarah wants to view her company's trade history on the trading platform. This can be done through the trade management system once she is signed in to her account. Once she navigates to the system, she can view her active, pending and completed trade orders. There will also be real-time order status tracking, allowing her to see her trade history changes being made in real time. The ability to place, buy, or sell orders will also be available, allowing her to directly manage her trades through this system.
