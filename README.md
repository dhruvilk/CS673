## Near Vision
Digital marketplace platforms provide a great service for independent and small businesses. But issues such as global access/availability, fraud, and streamlined experience within a platform's interface can be a burden for users. For UniTrade's first iteration, the main goal will strive to launch a functional commodity trading platform with peer-to-peer trading, streamlined UI/UX, and blockchain technology to reduce risk and disputes between UniTrade's buyers and sellers. UniTrade's key features will involve interoperability within financial institutions, automated trades, and setting a highly secure risk management protocol. 

UniTrade's first version will launch within three months and hope to meet at least 1,000 users within three to four months after its first initial release. Ongoing feedback will be collected and utilized to improve the app if any specific issue persists with a good piece of the user base. 

## Stakeholders
End Users (Buyers and Sellers):
Buyers purchasing ethical goods and services directly from others are one of the biggest stakeholders. Access to unique products, competitive pricing, and the ability to trade across the world is their priority. Sellers offering godos and services are driven by the buyer's interest. They will mainly benefit from peer-to-peer trading that will make UniTrade more seamless than other marketplace platforms.

Marketplace Platform Operators:
Teams that maintain various marketplace platforms will need UniTrade's smooth operations and platform security to make vital business transactions. This will lead to an expanding user base that offers global accessibility and peer-to-peer trading.

## Product Backlog Rationale
The product backlog is ordered in such a way to prioritize the Registration and Trade Data Entry module's core responsibilities within the UniTrade product. Backlog items that directly deal with features that own user data are the initial focus. Based on other needs beyond that other items slot in behind those core backlog items when they are needed.

Key Concepts Considered for Order Rationale:

1. Prioritize User Needs: The backlog ensures that the most important and valuable features are worked on first. By ordering items by priority, the team can focus on what matters most to stakeholders and the business, aligning the product development with business goals. A backlog captures user stories and features that are driven by the needs of the end-user. This helps ensure the product is being built with the user experience in mind, delivering features that solve real problems and enhances usability. 

2. Transparency and Readability: A well-maintained backlog provides transparency, making it clear what the team is working on, what’s next, and how it contributes to the overall product vision. This fosters collaboration and informed decision-making.

3. Breaking Down Complexity: The backlog should help break down large, complex tasks into manageable pieces, making it easier for the team to incrementally develop the module. The breaking down of complexity also supports more accurate estimation and resource planning.

4. Adaptability to Change: The backlog is organized to support flexiblility and making it easy to reorganize. As priorities shift the backlog can be updated to reflect the current priority without disrupting the entire project plan.

5. Team Collaboration: Backlog items can be discussed, refined, and clarified by the development team and stakeholders during team meetings. This improves understanding of the work, allows for collaboration and helps the team align around shared goals.
