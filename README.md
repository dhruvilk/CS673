## Far Vision (Needs to be review)
Vision: Unitrade aims to become the world’s leading digital trading platform for commodities, transforming the way buyers and sellers connect, transact, and manage risk in the global marketplace. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, Unitrade will create a seamless, transparent, and efficient ecosystem that empowers traders, businesses, and stakeholders at every level of the supply chain.

Key Pillars of the Vision:

Global Accessibility: Unitrade will democratize access to commodity trading, breaking down geographical barriers and opening up new markets for buyers and sellers of all sizes. The platform will serve as a global marketplace, with support for a wide range of commodities—from energy and metals to agricultural products—fostering new opportunities for emerging markets.

Blockchain-Enabled Transparency and Trust: The platform will integrate blockchain technology to provide a transparent, immutable ledger of all transactions. This ensures trust among participants by minimizing fraud, reducing disputes, and providing real-time data on the provenance, quality, and sustainability of commodities.

AI-Driven Insights and Predictive Analytics: Unitrade will harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer intelligent market insights, price forecasts, and trend analysis. This will enable traders to make data-driven decisions, optimize supply chains, and hedge against risks more effectively, ensuring they stay ahead in a highly competitive market.

Decentralized and Peer-to-Peer Trading: By embracing decentralized finance (DeFi) principles, Unitrade will facilitate peer-to-peer trading with reduced reliance on intermediaries. This will lower transaction costs, enhance liquidity, and create a more agile trading environment, especially for smaller participants who are often priced out of traditional exchanges.

Smart Contracts for Automated Settlements: Leveraging smart contract technology, Unitrade will automate the execution of trades, ensuring seamless and secure settlement. This will reduce the manual burden, eliminate delays, and enhance the efficiency of the trading process from order placement to delivery and payment.

Sustainability and Ethical Trading: The platform will be a leader in promoting sustainable and ethically sourced commodities. Through enhanced tracking and certification systems, Unitrade will empower traders to prioritize eco-friendly and fair trade products, aligning with global trends toward responsible business practices.

Interoperability Across Financial Ecosystems: Unitrade will integrate with global financial institutions, digital wallets, and payment systems, allowing traders to access various financing options such as trade credit, invoice factoring, and digital currencies. This will provide liquidity and flexibility for all participants in the ecosystem.

User-Centric Design and Intuitive Experience: With a focus on user experience, Unitrade will offer an intuitive interface, enabling even first-time traders to participate easily. The platform will provide tailored educational resources, community support, and tools that simplify complex trading strategies.

Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management: Unitrade will set the standard for compliance, adhering to global regulatory frameworks while offering built-in risk management tools. The platform will implement robust mechanisms for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and real-time monitoring to ensure secure and compliant trading operations.

## Your team has identified articulated a near vision for the first iteration of the product, which you will build in this project. It is clearly documented in your git repo's README.
Digital marketplace platforms provide a great service for independent and small businesses. But issues such as global access/availability, fraud, and streamlined experience within a platform's interface can be a burden for users. For UniTrade's first iteration, the main goal will strive to launch a functional commodity trading platform with peer-to-peer trading, streamlined UI/UX, and blockchain technology to reduce risk and disputes between UniTrade's buyers and sellers. UniTrade's key features will involve interoperability within financial institutions, automated trades, and setting a highly secure risk management protocol. 

UniTrade's first version will launch within three months and hope to meet at least 1,000 users within three to four months after its first initial release. Ongoing feedback will be collected and utilized to improve the app if any specific issue persists with a good piece of the user base. 


## Your team has identified at least three stakeholder types whose needs are fulfilled by your product. They are clearly documented in your git repo's README.
End Users (Buyers and Sellers):
Buyers purchasing ethical goods and services directly from others are one of the biggest stakeholders. Access to unique products, competitive pricing, and the ability to trade across the world is their priority. Sellers offering godos and services are driven by the buyer's interest. They will mainly benefit from peer-to-peer trading that will make UniTrade more seamless than other marketplace platforms.

Marketplace Platform Operators:
Teams that maintain various marketplace platforms will need UniTrade's smooth operations and platform security to make vital business transactions. This will lead to an expanding user base that offers global accessibility and peer-to-peer trading. 

Logistics Providers:
They will provide UniTrade's global shipping access. Their incentive is to generate revenue from shipping and handling services from marketplace participants. They will also provide a streamlined user experience with cost-effective and fast shipping.

## Your team has constructed an initial product backlog. The backlog is stored in Pivotal Tracker. The URL of your backlog is clearly documented in your git repo's README. Course staff members can view your backlog. 
Pivotal tracker isnt working for me. See the linked project for tickets/backlog items. 20 created and can be altered to fit a trading platform as opposed to a healthcare management platform

 

## There are at least 10 product backlog items in your product backlog.

 

## All product backlog items are expressed as excellent user stories.

 

## Your product backlog is ordered. Your rationale for how you ordered your backlog is clearly documented in your git repo's README.

 

## You have a Definition of Ready for product backlog items. Your Definition of Ready includes at least these items: a) Title, b) User story opening sentence, c) Additional details, d) Estimated in story points. Your Definition of Ready is clearly documented in your git repo's README.

 

## Estimate your PBIs, starting at the top of the backlog and working your way down to the bottom. Your backlog with estimated PBIs is stored in Pivotal Tracker. The URL of your backlog is clearly documented in your git repo's README. Course staff members can view your backlog.


## Estimated product backlog items (PBIs)

### Based on the information we've gathered from the user persona, our estimated PBIs are as follows:
- Intake Form Simplification
- Login Flow Optimization
- Account Status Dashboard / Landing Data
- Notifications and Alerts System
- Search Functionality Enhancement
- Data Entry Shortcuts For Common Inputs
- Responsive Table Layouts
- Breadcrumb Navigation
- Real-Time Data Sync Across Microservices
- Data Backup and Restore Procedures

Unfortunately, we were unable to add the PBIs to Pivotal Tracker for it is soon to be an obsolete service. As a result, we ultimately added the PBIs on [**GitHub Projects**](https://github.com/users/dhruvilk/projects/1).


## You estimated your PBIs in story points.

 

## You did a whole team relative size estimating activity. You documented the name of the activity in your README.
